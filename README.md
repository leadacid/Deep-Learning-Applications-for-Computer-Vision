# Deep-Learning-Applications-for-Computer-Vision
In this course, you’ll be learning about Computer Vision as a field of study and research. First we’ll be exploring several Computer Vision tasks and suggested approaches, from the classic Computer Vision perspective. Then we’ll introduce Deep Learning methods and apply them to some of the same problems. We will analyze the results and discuss advantages and drawbacks of both types of methods. We'll use tutorials to let you explore hands-on some of the modern machine learning tools and software libraries. Examples of Computer Vision tasks where Deep Learning can be applied include: image classification, image classification with localization, object detection, object segmentation, facial recognition, and activity or pose estimation.
